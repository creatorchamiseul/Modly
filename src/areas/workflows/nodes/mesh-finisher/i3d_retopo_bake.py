"""Quad-retopologise a generated mesh and transfer its texture onto the clean topology.

Run with:
    blender --background --python scripts/blender_retopo_bake.py -- IN.glb OUT.glb [faces] [size]

**Why.** Painting markings into a TRELLIS atlas cannot produce a crisp edge, and the cause
is not the unwrapper. Measured on Flicker (50k faces, 2048 atlas):

    TRELLIS xatlas          64.4% coverage   6,763 islands   median island 11 px
    + its own UV knobs      66.1%            9,052           13 px   (worse)
    Blender Smart UV        32.2%           10,943            6 px   (worse)

TRELLIS's own unwrap is the best of the three, and all of them are confetti. Generated
meshes are a chaotic triangle soup with no coherent surface flow, so there are no natural
charts for any unwrapper to find. **You cannot unwrap your way out of bad topology.**

So fix the topology. QuadriFlow rebuilds the surface as quads that follow its curvature,
which unwraps into large islands -- and then everything downstream, including
`scripts/project_markings.py`, works as designed.

**The bake is selected-to-active**, not a UV re-bake: remeshing throws the old UVs away, so
the texture has to be transferred from the original mesh onto the new one by ray casting
between the two surfaces. That is why this is a separate script from
`blender_reunwrap_bake.py`.

**What this costs.** Retopology is destructive to fine detail -- it resamples the surface.
Good for smooth subjects (Flicker's ceramic); expect it to damage foliage and fur, which
is consistent with remesh having previously destroyed leafy meshes here.

Headless on purpose: a Cycles bake through the live Blender socket blocks the GUI.
