"""Re-encode a GLB's textures, without touching its geometry.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/compress_glb_textures.py in.glb out.glb

**Why.** Retopology cut the Snag's geometry from 11.8 MB to 1.6 MB and the file still
weighed 32 MB, because Hunyuan's paint stage writes a 4096x4096 albedo *and* a 4096x4096
metallic-roughness map as uncompressed PNG: 30.5 MB of the 32. The mesh was never the
problem. Measured on that albedo, WebP at quality 90 holds 36.3 dB PSNR for 4.36 MB
against PNG's 16.0 — same pixels, same resolution, a quarter of the bytes.

**Resolution.** The paint stage emits 4096 and the default here is 2048, because a
generated asset does not carry 4096 worth of real detail — the rendered difference sits
inside the renderer's own sampling noise. `--max-size 0` keeps whatever came in.

**Colour maps and data maps are not the same thing** and this treats them differently.
An albedo is looked at, so perceptual coding is exactly right. A metallic-roughness or
normal map is *read as numbers* by the shader, so its resolution can usually drop far
below the albedo's without anyone seeing it, but heavy quantisation shows up as shading
artifacts rather than as blur. The defaults follow that: 2048 for colour, 1024 for the
rest, and quality 90 for both.

**Format.** JPEG is the default, not WebP, even though WebP is smaller — 4.7 MB against
3.5 on the Snag. JPEG is core glTF: no extension, nothing to negotiate, and it survives
every converter on the way to a game engine, which for this project means USDZ. WebP has
to travel as `EXT_texture_webp`, and the honest position on that is that there is no real
fallback: the extension is declared in `extensionsUsed` rather than `extensionsRequired`
and the texture keeps its plain `source`, but that source now points at the same WebP
bytes, so a reader that refuses a non-core mime type has nothing else to read. Blender and
trimesh both load it; a USD converter may not. `--format webp` when the destination is
known to handle it, which is the case for anything built on three.js.

The GLB is rewritten chunk-by-chunk rather than round-tripped through a mesh library:
accessors, skins, morph targets and extras all keep their indices, and only the image
byte ranges move.
